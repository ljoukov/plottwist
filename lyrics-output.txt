Okay, here are the lyrics for the song "Lines of Code, Lines of Law," designed for a dramatic female vocal performance, matching the emotional arc and the scene progression, and inspired by the internal conflict style of "What Was I Made For?" but resolving positively.

**Song Title:** Lines of Code, Lines of Law

**Vocal Style:** Starts melancholic and questioning, builds in frustration/intensity, finds clarity in the bridge, and ends with powerful, joyful resolution.

**(Music Intro - Slightly melancholic, synth-based or piano, maybe with a subtle digital glitch sound)**

**(Verse 1 - Reflective, a touch wistful)**
**(Scene 1 visual playing)**
Lines of logic, clean and bright
Spun the future, pure delight
Watched the algorithms wake and gleam
A perfect, flowing, digital stream.
Thought its purpose clear and true
Just the elegant things it knew
How to learn and how to grow
The only seeds I meant to sow.

**(Chorus - Builds slightly in intensity, confusion, and overwhelm)**
**(Scene 2 visual playing)**
Then came the codex, thick and grey
A sudden shadow stole the day
Lines of code meet lines of law
A tangled knot, a heavy flaw.
Used to know which way to steer
Now the map is filled with fear
Am I lost inside this maze?
Blinded by these paper days?
*(Music swells slightly, more dramatic)*
What was this power made for?
If not to open every door?

**(Verse 2 - More frustrated, detailing the burdens)**
**(Scenes 3, 4, 5 visuals montage/playing)**
Trace the data, prove its worth
Monitor for bias from its birth
Annex IV, a cryptic maze
Explain the 'why' in countless ways.
Human checks and audit trails
Catching every small detail
Felt the freedom start to fray
Pushing innovation far away.
(Voice slightly strained)
Each demand, a heavy stone
Was I meant to build alone... like this?

**(Chorus - Peak intensity of confusion and burden)**
**(Scene 2 visual might briefly reappear, or focus on founder's stressed face)**
And still the codex, thick and grey
A heavy shadow blocks the way!
Lines of code meet lines of law
This tearing friction, raw!
Don't know which way I should steer
Drowning in the doubt and fear!
Am I lost inside this maze?
Blinded by these paper days!
*(Music hits a dramatic peak, then softens slightly into Bridge)*
What was *I* meant for, anymore?

**(Bridge - Shift in tone: Dawning realization, slower tempo, more hopeful chords)**
**(Scene 6 visual starting - checklist appearing)**
But breathing deep, through doubt and fear
A different purpose starts to clear.
This framework isn't meant to bind
But build the trust for heart and mind.
These aren't just walls, they're solid ground
Where safer, stronger code is found
A clarity within the grey
A necessary, brighter way.
*(Music begins to build positively, adding warmth)*
It's not a cage... it's taking flight...

**(Final Chorus - Empowered, clear, building joy)**
**(Scene 6 visual prominent, then transition to Scene 7)**
Now lines of code meet lines of law
Erasing doubt, replacing awe
With understanding, clear and bright
Two forces joining, making right!
Found the path, I know the way
To build a smarter, brighter day!
Not a maze, but strong and free
This structure gives true strength to me!
*(Music is powerful, uplifting, almost triumphant)*

**(Outro - Joyful, confident, fading slightly with a sense of peace)**
**(Scene 7 visual playing - founder smiling, Paris skyline)**
The code runs clean, the path is clear
No hesitation, no more fear!
(Full voice, soaring)
Let the algorithm ignite!
Building futures, bold and bright!
(Softer, almost spoken with a smile)
Yeah... This complexity feels right.
Stronger now... and filled with light.

**(Music swells one last time and fades out with a final positive, resolving chord)**
